Morgan approached from behind, their footsteps silent on the forest floor. "You feel it too, don't you?" they asked, their voice soft but certain.

"I don't understand what's happening to me," Alex replied, turning to face their mentor. The connection between Alex and Morgan had always been strong, but now it felt like something more—like their destinies were intertwined.

As they walked through the shadowy woods, Alex couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched. The trees seemed to whisper secrets, and the very ground beneath their feet hummed with energy.

They emerged into a clearing where a figure waited—tall, cloaked, and radiating an aura of mystery. It was Luna.

"Alex," Luna said, their voice like wind through leaves. "We've been waiting for you."
