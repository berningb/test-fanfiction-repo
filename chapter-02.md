# Chapter 2: The Crystal Tower

The journey to Crystal Tower took three days. Alex, Morgan, and Luna traveled together, and with each passing mile, Alex's understanding of their own power grew. The relationship between Alex and Morgan deepened, built on trust and shared purpose.

When they finally reached Crystal Tower, the ancient structure rose before them like a beacon of knowledge. The tower had stood for a thousand years, its crystalline walls catching the light and scattering it in rainbow patterns across the courtyard.

Sage met them at the entrance, their robes flowing in the breeze. "Welcome, travelers," they said, their eyes twinkling with wisdom. "We've been expecting you."

Inside, the tower was even more magnificent. Halls lined with books stretched in every direction, and students moved through the corridors with purpose. Alex felt a sense of belonging here, as if they had finally found their place in the world.

Morgan led them to a chamber where maps covered the walls. "This is where we'll plan our next move," Morgan explained. "The Northern Keep has been sending messages. River needs our help."

Alex looked at the map, tracing the route from Crystal Tower to Northern Keep. The relationship between the different locations was clear—each place connected to the others in ways that seemed almost magical.

"What's happening at Northern Keep?" Alex asked.

"War," Luna said simply. "And we're needed there."
