# Chapter 3: The Northern Keep

The journey north was treacherous. Snow covered the ground, and the wind cut through their cloaks like knives. But Alex, Morgan, and Luna pressed on, driven by the urgency of River's message.

When they finally arrived at Northern Keep, the fortress loomed before them—a massive structure of stone and ice, built into the side of a mountain. River stood at the gates, their armor gleaming in the cold light.

"Alex! Morgan!" River called out, relief evident in their voice. "Thank the gods you're here. We don't have much time."

Inside the keep, the situation was dire. The relationship between River and their people was strained—they were warriors, but they were also protectors, and the weight of responsibility showed on River's face.

"The enemy approaches from the east," River explained, pointing to a map spread across a table. "They'll be here by dawn. We need a plan."

Alex studied the map, their mind racing. The connection between their magic and the land itself was growing stronger, and they could feel the approaching threat like a dark cloud on the horizon.

"What if we don't fight them head-on?" Alex suggested. "What if we use the terrain? Shadowmere Forest isn't far from here. We could lead them there, use the forest's magic against them."

Morgan nodded, their expression thoughtful. "It's risky, but it might work. The relationship between the forest and your power could be the key."

Luna stepped forward. "I know a way through Shadowmere Forest that the enemy won't expect. If we can get them to follow us, we can trap them."

River looked at each of them in turn, then smiled grimly. "Then that's what we'll do. But first, we need to prepare."
